API Calls with Axios
====================

As our app currently stands, the events that we‚Äôre displaying are simply hard-coded within the data of the **EventListView.vue** component. In a real-world app, there would likely be some sort of database of events that we would be pulling from. Our app would make a request for the events, the server would respond with those events (as JSON), and we‚Äôd take those events and set them as our component‚Äôs data (ref), which we then display in the view.

So our tasks in this lesson include:

*   Create a mock database to house our events
*   Install a library (Axios) to make API Calls
*   Implement a `getEvents()` API call
*   Refactor our API code into a service layer

* * *

Our Mock Database
-----------------

To create our mock database, we‚Äôll be using [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/), which is a simple solution that requires no installation. We just need a Github repo with a **db.json** file in it. If you‚Äôve been coding along, you may have already noticed that I‚Äôve added a **db.json** file to the course‚Äôs repo:

üìÑ¬†**db.json**

    {
      "events": [
        {
          "id": 123,
          "category": "animal welfare",
          "title": "Cat Adoption Day",
          "description": "Find your new feline friend at this event.",
          "location": "Meow Town",
          "date": "January 28, 2022",
          "time": "12:00",
          "organizer": "Kat Laydee"
        },
        {
          "id": 456,
          "category": "food",
          "title": "Community Gardening",
          "description": "Join us as we tend to the community edible plants.",
          "location": "Flora City",
          "date": "March 14, 2022",
          "time": "10:00",
          "organizer": "Fern Pollin"
        },
        {
          "id": 789,
          "category": "sustainability",
          "title": "Beach Cleanup",
          "description": "Help pick up trash along the shore.",
          "location": "Playa Del Carmen",
          "date": "July 22, 2022",
          "time": "11:00",
          "organizer": "Carey Wales"
        }
      ]
    }
    

This code should look very familiar to you, since it‚Äôs a JSON version of the `events` data that is currently within the local data of our **EventListView.vue** component. This is the data we‚Äôre going to soon be fetching with our new API call.

In order to access our mock server, we‚Äôll go to the url:

**[my-json-server.typicode.com/{GithubUserName}/{RepoName}](my-json-server.typicode.com/{GithubUserName}/{RepoName})**

(Obviously, if you‚Äôre creating your own **db.json** file within your own Github account‚Äôs repo, you‚Äôll want to fill in the blanks for your **UserName** and **RepoName** here.)

Adding ‚Äò**/events**‚Äô to the end of the URL allows us to target the events data specifically, so **[my-json-server.typicode.com/{GithubUserName}/{RepoName}/events](http://my-json-server.typicode.com/{GithubUserName}/{RepoName}/events)** is the URL we‚Äôll soon use to make our call.

* * *

Axios for API Calls
-------------------

Now that we have our mock database and know what URL to call out to, we‚Äôre ready to install a library to help us make API calls. We‚Äôll be using the [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios) library.

From terminal, when cd‚Äôd into the root of your project, run:

    npm install axios
    

Why are we using Axios? It‚Äôs very popular and includes many features including:

*   GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
*   Add authentication to each request
*   Set timeouts if requests take too long
*   Configure defaults for every request
*   Intercept requests to create middleware
*   Handle errors and cancel requests properly
*   Properly serialize and deserialize requests & responses
*   And more‚Ä¶

Now that we‚Äôve installed it, we can start using it and write our first API Call.

* * *

Implementing Axios to get events
--------------------------------

To write our API call, we‚Äôll head into the **EventListView.vue** component, delete out the hard-coded `events` data (replace with `null`), import Axios, then import/add the `onMounted` lifecycle hook.

**üìÅ¬†src/views/EventListView.vue**

    <script setup>
    import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import axios from 'axios'
    
    const events = ref(null)
    
    onMounted(() => {
      // get events from mock db when component is created
    })
    </script>
    

If lifecycle hooks are a new concept to you, you just need to understand that a component has a lifecycle and different hooks (or methods) are run at those different stages in its lifecycle. For example, before it‚Äôs created, when it‚Äôs created, before it‚Äôs mounted, when it‚Äôs mounted, and so on.

![Screen Shot 2022-12-28 at 3.37.13 PM.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F2.1672338395928.jpg?alt=media&token=2428d867-fb57-4f40-afe3-ae620cbf1647)

In our case, we want to make our API call and get our events when the component is `onMounted`, so we‚Äôll run the `get` method available to us on `axios`, passing in the my-json-server url as the argument (where we want to _get_ from).

**üìÅ¬†src/views/EventListView.vue**

    import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    import axios from 'axios'
    
    const events = ref(null)
    
    onMounted(() => {
      axios
        .get('https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Code-Pop/Real-World_Vue-3/events')
        .then((response) => {
          events.value = response.data
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error)
        })
    })
    

Because Axios is a promise-based library and runs asynchronously, we need to be waiting for the promise returned from the `get` request to resolve before proceeding. That‚Äôs why we added the `.then`, which allows us to wait for the `response` and set our local `events` ref equal to it.

Because we want to grab any errors that occur, we‚Äôve also added `.catch` and we‚Äôre just logging the `error` to the console. While there are production-level solutions for error-handing, we won‚Äôt be delving into that in this course. This solution serves our needs for this simple implementation.

(In case you‚Äôre wondering: we could‚Äôve used the alternative [async / await](https://scotch.io/tutorials/asynchronous-javascript-using-async-await) syntax instead of `.then`. I‚Äôve chosen this syntax since I assume more people are already familiar with it, and I find it a bit less abstract for newcomers. Both work just fine, and I encourage you to write your asynchronous calls as you and your team prefer.)

If we check this out in the browser, we should now be seeing our events being displayed, pulled in smoothly from our newly implemented mock server.

* * *

Reorganizing our code into a service layer
------------------------------------------

While we‚Äôve made great progress, there‚Äôs a problem with our code. Currently, we‚Äôre importing Axios into the **EventListView.vue** component. But in the next lesson, we‚Äôre going to create a new component, which displays our event‚Äôs details. That new component will also need to make an API call. If we‚Äôre importing Axios into each component that needs it, we‚Äôre unnecessarily creating a new instance of Axios each time we do that. With API code woven throughout our application, this gets messy and makes our app harder to debug.

![axios_problem.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F3.1672338403022.jpg?alt=media&token=7e63d8f3-7ab8-444d-a79c-8c938193405d)

A cleaner and more scalable solution is to modularize our API code into a service layer. To do so, we‚Äôll created a **services** folder in our src directory and create a new **EventService.js** file.

![event-service.png](https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/vue-mastery.appspot.com/o/flamelink%2Fmedia%2F4.1672338403023.jpg?alt=media&token=36291485-f410-49ab-98c2-dd9edb987062)

**üìÅ src/services/EventService.js**

    import axios from 'axios'
    
    const apiClient = axios.create({
      baseURL: 'https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Code-Pop/Real-World_Vue-3',
      withCredentials: false,
      headers: {
        Accept: 'application/json',
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    })
    
    export default {
      getEvents() {
        return apiClient.get('/events')
      }
    }
    

At the top, we‚Äôre importing Axios. Below that, we‚Äôve added an `apiClient` constant, which holds our singular Axios instance. As you can see, we‚Äôve set up a `baseURL` and some other configurations for Axios to use as it communicates with our server.

Now that we‚Äôve set that up, we can export a method that _gets_ our events, using our new Axios `apiClient`.

**üìÅ¬†src/services/EventService.js**

    ...
    
    export default {
      getEvents() {
        return apiClient.get('/events')
      }
    }
    

As you can see, we still have access to the Axios `get` method, and we‚Äôre passing in `'/events'` as the argument when making this call. This string will be added to our `baseURL`, so the request will be made to: [‚Äòhttps://my-json-server.typicode.com/Code-Pop/Real-World\_Vue-3/events‚Äô]('https://my-json-server.typicode.com/Code-Pop/Real-World_Vue-3/events').

* * *

Next up, we just need to make use of this new **EventService** within our **EventListView.vue** component, deleting out the Axios import, importing the EventService, and running its `getEvents()` call.

**üìÅ¬†src/views/EventListView.vue**

    <script setup>
    import { ref, onMounted } from 'vue'
    import EventCard from '@/components/EventCard.vue'
    ~~import axios from 'axios'~~
    import EventService from '@/services/EventService.js'
    
    const events = ref(null)
    
    onMounted(() => {
      EventService.getEvents()
        .then((response) => {
          events.value = response.data
        })
        .catch((error) => {
          console.log(error)
        })
    })
    </script>
    
    <template>
      <h1>Events For Good</h1>
      <div class="events">
        <EventCard v-for="event in events" :key="event.id" :event="event" />
      </div>
    </template>
    
    <style scoped>
    .events {
      display: flex;
      flex-direction: column;
      align-items: center;
    }
    </style>
    

And with that, we‚Äôve refactored our API code into a modular service layer.

Up Next
-------

When viewing our events in the browser, the **EventCards** look clickable. Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could click on them and view more details about that event? In the next lesson, we‚Äôll learn how to achieve this with Vue Router‚Äôs dynamic routing abilities.
