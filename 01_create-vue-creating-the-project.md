# Create-Vue - creating the project

In this tutorial, we‚Äôll create our project using create-vue, which is a CLI tool based on a build tool called Vite.js. We‚Äôll be touring the project that the CLI generates for us to get comfortable working within these files and folders.

## Why a CLI?

As you probably know, CLI stands for Command Line Interface, and it provides a full system for rapid Vue.js development. This means it does a lot of tedious work for us and provides us with valuable features out-of-the-box.

**It allows us to select which libraries our project will be using**

Then it automatically plugs them into the project.

**It‚Äôs based on Vite.js**

All of our JavaScript files, our CSS, and our dependencies get delivered in a lightning fast build for development.

**It allows us to write our HTML, CSS & JavaScript however we like**

We can use single-file .vue components, TypeScript, SCSS, Pug, the latest versions of ECMAScript, etc.

**It enables Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**

When you save your project, changes appear instantly in the browser.

## Creating a Vue project

To generate a new app using create-vue:

`npx create-vue real-world-vue`

This command will start the creation of a Vue project, with the name of ‚Äúreal-world-vue‚Äù.

This will start guiding us through a process where we select the options to configure our project:

We can choose Yes/No for each option.

We‚Äôre going to choose No for **TypeScript** and **JSX Support**.

For **Vue Router** and **Pinia**, we‚Äôll choose Yes.

And then, we‚Äôll choose No for **Unit Testing** and **Cypress**.

Lastly, we‚Äôll choose Yes for **ESLint** and **Prettier** for code linting and formatting respectively.

After going through the options, our project will be created automatically.

## Serving our Project

Once our project is done being created, we can cd into it.

Install all the dependencies for our new project:

`npm install`

In order to view it live in our browser, we‚Äôll run the command npm run dev, which compiles the app and serves it live at a local host (http://localhost:5173).

Above is our app, running live in the browser. It already has two pages, the Home page and the About page, which we can navigate between because it‚Äôs using Vue Router.

## Touring our Vue Project

Now that we know how to create our project from the terminal and also from the UI, let‚Äôs take a look at the project that was created for us.

![image](https://github.com/Viveksingh1990/real-world-vue-3-composition-api/assets/34119931/cb0a7b61-bcd0-4059-9c8c-c6242721fce4)

The node_modules directory is where all of the libraries we need to build Vue are stored.

The src directory is where you‚Äôll spend most of your time since it houses all of the application code.

You‚Äôll want to put the majority of your assets, such as images and fonts, in the assets directory so they can be optimized by Vite.

The components directory is where we store the components, or building blocks, of our Vue app.

The router folder is used for Vue Router, which enables our site navigation. We use Vue Router to pull up the different ‚Äúviews‚Äù of our single page application.

The stores is where we put Pinia code, which handles state management throughout the app. By the end of this course, you‚Äôll have a basic understanding of what Pinia is for, but we won‚Äôt be implementing any Pinia code. This course serves as a foundational course that prepares you for our other courses on Pinia

The views directory is where we store component files for the different views of our app, which Vue Router loads up.

The App.vue file is the root component that all other components are nested within.

The main.js file is what renders our App.vue component (and everything nested within it) and mounts it to the DOM.

eslintrc.cjs and .prettier.json are configuration files for ESLint and Prettier.

The index.html file is where the App.vue component will be mounted to.

Next, we have a .gitignore file where we can specify what we want git to ignore, along our package.json, which helps npm identify the project and handle its dependencies, and a README.md.

Finally, there‚Äôs a vite.config.js since this is an app running on Vite.js

## How the App is Loaded

You might be wondering now, how is the app being loaded? Let‚Äôs take a look at that process.

üìÅ src/main.js

```vue
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { createPinia } from 'pinia'

import App from './App.vue'
import router from './router'

import './assets/main.css'

const app = createApp(App)

app.use(createPinia())
app.use(router)

app.mount('#app')
```

In our main.js file, we‚Äôre importing the createApp method from Vue, along with our App.js component. We‚Äôre then running that method, feeding in the App (the root component that includes all of our application code since all other components are nested within it).

As the method name explicitly states, this creates the app and we‚Äôre telling it to use the router and a newly created Pinia instance. Finally, the app is mounted to the DOM via the mount method, which takes in an argument to specify where in the DOM the app should be mounted. But where exactly is this id of "#app"?

If we peek inside our index.html file, we can see there‚Äôs a div with the id of "app":

üìÅ index.html

```vue
<div id="app"></div>
```

This is where our Vue app is being mounted. Later, we‚Äôll gain a deeper understanding of how this index.html serves as the ‚Äúsingle page‚Äù of our single page application.

## Putting it all together

Let‚Äôs take a look at this process more visually:

## Wrapping Up

You should now have an understanding of how we can create a Vue project and how to manage it from the Vue UI. We also explored the project that was created for us to get ready to start customizing this project. In the next lesson, we‚Äôll build our first single file .vue component.
